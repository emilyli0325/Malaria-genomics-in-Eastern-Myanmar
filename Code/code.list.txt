# Step 1: Sequencing Data Processing
# This step includes quality control, read alignment to a reference genome, filtering of raw sequencing reads, and genotyping.

# Step 2: Generating Data Matrix
# In this step, we construct data matrices representing genetic distances, geographic distances, and temporal distances between samples.

# Step 3: Epidemiological Analysis
# This includes analyses such as k13 genotype characterization, relationships between genetic distances, geographic distances and temporal distances, and correlation studies.

# Step 4: Generating Individual Figures
# Visualization of analytical results using custom plots generated in R.
